      ### [3] Add This Card To Page 4 Times
      
      ### [4] Use Template Literals For Concatenate
# Task-01
      --Create two variables named Number One and Number Two using the appropriate way and standards for variable naming.
      --The first variable has a value of 10 and its data type is Number.
      --The second variable has a value of 20 and its data type is Number.
      --In the first line, print the result 1020 to the Console using the regular Concatenate method.
      --In the second line, print the data type 1020 to the Console using the regular Concatenate method.
      --In the third line, print the result 1020 to the Console using Template Literals for concatenation.
      --In the fourth line, print the data type 1020 to the Console using Template Literals for concatenation.
      --In the fifth and sixth lines, without repeating the Console.log, print the number 20 followed by the number 10 using regular Concatenate.
      --In the seventh and eighth lines, without repeating the Console.log, print the number 20 followed by the number 10 using Template Literals
# Task-03
      Print the following result without using the Template Literals method for concatenation.
      
      `I'm In
      \\
      Love \\ """ '''
      ++ With ++
      \"""\"""
      ""JavaScript""``
# Task-04
      --Use the variables to produce the result found in the code.
      --You cannot repeat any variable more than once.
      --You cannot manually write any numbers; you must use only the values of the variables.
      
      let a = 21;
      let b = 20;
      console.log("Write Your Code Here"); // _21_2021_2021_2021_20_
